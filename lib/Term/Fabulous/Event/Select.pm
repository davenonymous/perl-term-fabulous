=head1 NAME

Term::Fabulous::Event::Select - The user opened or closed an item of an accordion, or chose a tab

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	$accordion->on( Select => sub ($event) {
		my $item = $event->item;
		$status->text( $event->open ? 'Opened ' . $item->title : 'Closed ' . $item->title );
		return;
	} );

	$tabs->on( Select => sub ($event) {
		$status->text( 'Showing ' . $event->item->title );
		return;
	} );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A widget that lets the user pick one of its items fires C<Select> on
itself when the user does so:

=over

=item *

A L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::Accordion>, when the user opens or closes
one of its items: with a click on the item's header, with C<Enter> or
C<Space> while the header has the focus, or through
C<< $accordion->choose($index) >>, which acts as the user does. Opening
and closing from your program (C<open>, C<close>, C<open_all>,
C<close_all>, C<< $item->open(1) >>) fires nothing. When opening one
item closes another, because the accordion allows one open item at a
time, only the item the user acted on fires.

=item *

A L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::Tabs>, when the user chooses another tab:
with a click on it, with an arrow key, C<Home> or C<End> while the
active tab has the focus, with C<Ctrl+PageUp> or C<Ctrl+PageDown>
from anywhere inside, or through C<< $tabs->choose($index) >>. The
item is the page now shown. Choosing from your program (C<select>,
C<< $page->active(1) >>) fires nothing, and so does choosing the tab
that is active already.

=item *

A L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::Tabs::Bar> used on its own, likewise; the
item is then the tab, a L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::Tabs::Button>. Under
a Tabs, the bar's event does not bubble past the Tabs, which fires its
own with the page.

=back

It is a L<Clay::UI::Events::Event> whose name is C<Select>; listen for
it with C<< $widget->on( Select => sub ($event) { ... } ) >>. It
bubbles to the widget's ancestors like every event (see
L<Term::Fabulous::Manual::Events/Return values and bubbling>), and
C<< $event->target >> is the accordion, the Tabs or the bar.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

	my $event = Term::Fabulous::Event::Select->new( item => $item, index => 2, open => 1 );

The widgets build these events themselves; build one yourself only to
test your listeners, or to fire C<Select> from a widget of your own.
Unknown parameters die, and so does an C<index> that is not a
non-negative integer.

=over

=item C<item>

Required. See L</item>.

=item C<index>

Required. See L</index>.

=item C<open>

A boolean. Default: 1. See L</open>.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 item

The widget the user chose: a L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::Accordion::Item>,
a L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::Tabs::Page> (from a Tabs) or a
L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::Tabs::Button> (from a bar on its own).

=head2 index

Its position among the accordion's items or the tabs, from 0.

=head2 open

1 when the item was opened or the tab chosen, 0 when an accordion
item was closed.
