	# At its natural size: as many cells as its pixels cover.
	my $photo = Term::Fabulous::Widget::Sixel->new( file => 'examples/images/mandelbrot.png' );

	# Scaled to fit 40 columns and 12 rows, from bytes or base64 text.
	my $preview = Term::Fabulous::Widget::Sixel->new(
		data   => $png_bytes,
		fit    => 'contain',
		layout => { sizing => { width => sizing_fixed(40), height => sizing_fixed(12) } },
	);
	my $logo = Term::Fabulous::Widget::Sixel->new( base64 => $base64_text );

	# Another picture later.

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davenonymous/perl-term-fabulous/v0.01/screenshots/widget-sixel.svg" alt="A detail of the Mandelbrot set, blue and white spirals with orange and dark red bands, in sixel graphics in three frames of 28x10 cells: cut to the frame at its natural size (none), scaled down to fit the frame with its proportions kept (contain) and stretched to fill the frame (stretch)"></p>

=end html

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The picture shows a 480x320 PNG of the Mandelbrot set in three widgets
of a fixed 28x10 cells, one per fit, in a terminal with cells of 10x20
pixels: C<none> (the default) keeps its natural size of 48x16 cells,
cut to the widget on every side, C<contain> scales it to fit and keeps
its proportions, C<stretch> fills the widget. The program is
F<examples/widgets/sixel.pl>.

A sixel widget shows a picture like L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::Image>,
but in the terminal's own pixels instead of half blocks: the terminal
draws it as a sixel image over the widget's cells. It reads the same
sources (a file, bytes, base64 text or a data URL, in whatever formats
your L<Imager> was built with), takes the same parameters and scales
the same way (see L</fit>); it is a subclass of Image.

Unless the C<layout> sizes it, the widget is as big as the picture: as
many columns and rows as its pixels cover, with the size of a cell the
terminal reports. Given another size, the picture keeps its natural
size, or is scaled as L</fit> says, and is centered in the widget.

Term::Fabulous sends a picture to the terminal when it first shows,
when it changes, moves or is resized, and when the cells below it are
drawn again; otherwise the terminal keeps it on the screen. A picture
that disappears gets its cells drawn again, which erases it.

=head2 What covers the picture

Everything the frame paints over the widget hides the picture there,
cell by cell: a dialog, a dropdown's list, a toast, another widget
floating over it. Those cells are left out of the picture (its pixels
there are transparent), so they show what is painted in them. In a
L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::ScrollBox>, the picture shows only in the
visible cells of the widget.

A picture never covers the last row of the terminal: the terminal would
scroll the screen up to place its cursor below it. The cells of the
widget in that row stay empty.

=head2 Transparency

Transparent pixels are not drawn, so the cells below them show the
background. Translucent pixels are mixed with the background below the
widget (the widget's own C<background_color> or the nearest one below
it, see L<Term::Fabulous::Widget/background_below>), like Image does.
Where there is none, on the terminal's default background, pixels with
an alpha of at least 128 are drawn opaque and the others are left out.

=head2 Without sixel

The widget needs the Perl modules L<Imager> and L<Imager::File::SIXEL>,
and a terminal that shows sixel graphics and reports the size of its
cells in pixels. Neither module is a requirement of Term::Fabulous,
only a recommendation. Without one of them, or on another terminal,
the class still loads and takes the same parameters, so programs and
layouts work unchanged, but it shows a notice in its place instead of
the picture, like Image does without Imager:

=for highlighter language=text

	Sixel needs a terminal that
	shows sixel graphics and
	reports the size of its
	cells.

The notices name the missing module instead, for example
C<Sixel needs the Perl module Imager::File::SIXEL, which is not
installed.> They are drawn in C<notice_color>, wrapped at 28 columns
unless the layout gives the widget another width.

L<Term::Fabulous::Terminal::Termbox> asks the terminal when it opens
it: the terminal shows sixel graphics when its primary device
attributes (the answer to C<ESC [ c>) list C<4>, as those of xterm
(started with C<-ti vt340>), foot, WezTerm, mlterm, Contour, Konsole,
iTerm2 and Windows Terminal do. The size of a cell comes from the
terminal's answer to C<ESC [ 16 t>, else from the pixel size of the
terminal device's window (C<TIOCGWINSZ>). A terminal that shows sixel
graphics is asked again after it is resized, since a new font size
changes the size of a cell.
L<Term::Fabulous::Static> and L<Term::Fabulous::Terminal::Memory>
(unless given C<sixel_cell_size>) show no sixel graphics.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

=for highlighter language=perl

	my $picture = Term::Fabulous::Widget::Sixel->new(%parameters);

Accepts the parameters of L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::Image/new>:
C<file>, C<data>, C<base64>, C<data_url>, C<fit> and C<notice_color>,
besides those of L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::Box/CONSTRUCTOR>. They work
the same, except:

=over

=item C<fit>

C<none> (the default) draws the picture at its natural size, cut on
every side if it is larger than the widget; C<contain> scales it to the
largest size that fits the widget's pixels, keeping its proportions;
C<stretch> scales it to fill them. The widget's pixels are its columns
and rows times the size of a cell. Enlarging repeats pixels (nearest
neighbor), shrinking mixes them.

=item C<notice_color>

The color of the notice shown without sixel. Default: the theme's
C<image.notice>, like Image.

=back

=head1 METHODS

The methods of L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::Image>: L<file|Term::Fabulous::Widget::Image/file>,
L<data|Term::Fabulous::Widget::Image/data>, L<base64|Term::Fabulous::Widget::Image/base64>,
L<data_url|Term::Fabulous::Widget::Image/data_url>, L<fit|Term::Fabulous::Widget::Image/fit>,
L<notice_color|Term::Fabulous::Widget::Image/notice_color>,
L<image_width|Term::Fabulous::Widget::Image/image_width> and
L<image_height|Term::Fabulous::Widget::Image/image_height>, plus:

=head2 sixel_data

	my $data = $picture->sixel_data( shown => [ 0, 0, 8, 4 ], covered => [], cell_size => [ 10, 20 ] );

Called by the renderer (see L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::Canvas/sixel_data>)
once per frame: the picture's pixels in the C<shown> cells of the
widget as SIXEL data, transparent in the C<covered> ones, or C<undef>
when the widget shows a notice or has no picture. The data of the last
call is kept and returned again while nothing changes.

=head1 EVENTS

A sixel widget fires no events of its own.
