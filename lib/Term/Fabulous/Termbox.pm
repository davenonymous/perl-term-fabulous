=head1 DESCRIPTION

An XS binding of L<termbox2|https://github.com/termbox/termbox2>, compiled
from the header shipped in the distribution (F<src/termbox2.h>, see
F<src/README.termbox2> for the exact upstream commit). Nothing is looked up
at run time, and the compile-time options are fixed:

=over

=item *

C<TB_OPT_ATTR_W> is 64: an attribute carries a 24-bit color and every
style bit, C<TB_STRIKEOUT>, C<TB_UNDERLINE_2>, C<TB_OVERLINE> and
C<TB_INVISIBLE> included. L<tb_attr_width|/"tb_has_truecolor, tb_has_egc, tb_attr_width, tb_version"> reports 64.

=item *

C<TB_OPT_EGC> is set: a cell holds a whole grapheme cluster
(L</tb_extend_cell>, L</tb_set_cell_ex>). L<tb_has_egc|/"tb_has_truecolor, tb_has_egc, tb_attr_width, tb_version"> reports 1.

=item *

termbox2 measures with its own Unicode tables (C<TB_OPT_LIBC_WCHAR> is
not set), so widths are the same on every platform. L</tb_wcwidth> and
L</tb_cluster_width> expose exactly the functions C<tb_present> uses.

=back

Every function keeps its termbox2 name and returns its status code, C<TB_OK>
or one of the C<TB_ERR_*> constants; nothing dies on a terminal error.
The exceptions are arguments the binding cannot translate at all, such as
an empty string where a character is needed, which die before termbox2 is
called.

=head1 EXPORTS

Nothing is exported by default. The tags are

=over

=item C<:api>

The functions below, except the width functions.

=item C<:width>

L</tb_iswprint>, L</tb_wcwidth>, L</tb_cluster_width>.

=item C<:keys>

Every C<TB_KEY_*> constant, plus the Term::Fabulous additions
C<TF_KEY_MOUSE_MOVE>, C<TF_KEY_MOUSE_WHEEL_LEFT> and
C<TF_KEY_MOUSE_WHEEL_RIGHT>, and the keys only the kitty keyboard
protocol reports (see L</tf_install_input_parser> and L</Kitty keys>): the
ASCII control range (C<TB_KEY_CTRL_A> to
C<TB_KEY_CTRL_Z>, C<TB_KEY_TAB>, C<TB_KEY_ENTER>, C<TB_KEY_ESC>,
C<TB_KEY_SPACE>, C<TB_KEY_BACKSPACE>, C<TB_KEY_BACKSPACE2>, ...), the
function and navigation keys (C<TB_KEY_F1> to C<TB_KEY_F12>,
C<TB_KEY_ARROW_*>, C<TB_KEY_HOME>, C<TB_KEY_END>, C<TB_KEY_PGUP>,
C<TB_KEY_PGDN>, C<TB_KEY_INSERT>, C<TB_KEY_DELETE>, C<TB_KEY_BACK_TAB>) and
the mouse "keys" (C<TB_KEY_MOUSE_LEFT>, C<TB_KEY_MOUSE_RIGHT>,
C<TB_KEY_MOUSE_MIDDLE>, C<TB_KEY_MOUSE_RELEASE>, C<TB_KEY_MOUSE_WHEEL_UP>,
C<TB_KEY_MOUSE_WHEEL_DOWN>).

=item C<:colors>

C<TB_DEFAULT>, the eight basic colors C<TB_BLACK> to C<TB_WHITE>, and the
style bits C<TB_BOLD>, C<TB_UNDERLINE>, C<TB_REVERSE>, C<TB_ITALIC>,
C<TB_BLINK>, C<TB_HI_BLACK>, C<TB_BRIGHT>, C<TB_DIM>, C<TB_STRIKEOUT>,
C<TB_UNDERLINE_2>, C<TB_OVERLINE>, C<TB_INVISIBLE>. In truecolor mode the
low 24 bits of an attribute are the RGB value; since C<0x000000> means
"terminal default" there, opaque black is C<TB_HI_BLACK>. The deprecated
aliases C<TB_TRUECOLOR_BOLD>, C<TB_TRUECOLOR_UNDERLINE>,
C<TB_TRUECOLOR_REVERSE>, C<TB_TRUECOLOR_ITALIC>, C<TB_TRUECOLOR_BLINK>,
C<TB_TRUECOLOR_BLACK> are exported too.

=item C<:event>

C<TB_EVENT_KEY>, C<TB_EVENT_RESIZE>, C<TB_EVENT_MOUSE>; the modifiers
C<TB_MOD_ALT>, C<TB_MOD_CTRL>, C<TB_MOD_SHIFT>, C<TB_MOD_MOTION>, and the
Term::Fabulous additions C<TF_MOD_SUPER>, C<TF_MOD_HYPER>, C<TF_MOD_META>
(16, 32, 64; only the kitty keyboard protocol reports them); the input
modes C<TB_INPUT_CURRENT>, C<TB_INPUT_ESC>, C<TB_INPUT_ALT>,
C<TB_INPUT_MOUSE>; the output modes C<TB_OUTPUT_CURRENT>,
C<TB_OUTPUT_NORMAL>, C<TB_OUTPUT_256>, C<TB_OUTPUT_216>,
C<TB_OUTPUT_GRAYSCALE>, C<TB_OUTPUT_TRUECOLOR>.

C<:keys>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 Lifecycle

=head3 tb_init, tb_init_file, tb_init_fd, tb_init_rwfd

	my $rc = tb_init();
	my $rc = tb_init_file('/dev/tty');
	my $rc = tb_init_fd($ttyfd);
	my $rc = tb_init_rwfd( $rfd, $wfd );

Open the terminal. C<tb_init> uses F</dev/tty>.

=head3 tf_init_inline, tf_init_inline_rwfd

	my $rc = tf_init_inline();
	my $rc = tf_init_inline_rwfd( $rfd, $wfd );

A Term::Fabulous addition: open the terminal like C<tb_init> and
C<tb_init_rwfd>, but without taking over the screen. termbox2 then
neither switches to the alternate screen nor clears the screen, not
when it starts, not on a resize and not in C<tb_shutdown>, so what the
terminal showed before stays. The cell buffers still cover the whole
terminal and C<tb_present> still places cells at absolute positions:
the caller paints only the rows it owns (see L</tf_cursor_position>)
and leaves the others as C<tb_clear> left them, so that C<tb_present>
sends nothing for them. The C<inline> parameter of L<Term::Fabulous/new>
is built on this.

=head3 tb_shutdown

Restores the terminal.

=head3 tb_width, tb_height

The terminal size in cells, or C<TB_ERR_NOT_INIT> before L<tb_init|/"tb_init, tb_init_file, tb_init_fd, tb_init_rwfd">.

=head3 tb_set_input_mode, tb_set_output_mode

	tb_set_input_mode( TB_INPUT_ESC | TB_INPUT_MOUSE );
	tb_set_output_mode(TB_OUTPUT_TRUECOLOR);

=head2 Drawing

=head3 tb_clear, tb_set_clear_attrs, tb_present, tb_invalidate

As in termbox2: C<tb_clear> fills the back buffer with the clear
attributes, C<tb_present> sends the changed cells, C<tb_invalidate> forces
a full redraw on the next C<tb_present>.

=head3 tb_set_cursor, tb_hide_cursor

	tb_set_cursor( $x, $y );
	tb_hide_cursor();

Show the terminal cursor at cell (C<$x>, C<$y>), or hide it. Both return
C<TB_OK> or an error code; the change shows with the next C<tb_present>.

=head3 tb_set_cell

	tb_set_cell( $x, $y, $character, $fg, $bg );

Writes one cell. C<$character> is a Perl string whose first codepoint is
used; an integer that was never a string is taken as the codepoint itself.
An empty string dies.

=head3 tb_extend_cell

	tb_extend_cell( $x, $y, $character );

Appends the first codepoint of C<$character> to the cell's grapheme
cluster.

=head3 tb_set_cell_ex

	tb_set_cell_ex( $x, $y, $cluster, $fg, $bg );

Writes a whole grapheme cluster at once: every codepoint of C<$cluster>.

=head3 tb_get_cell

	my ( $rc, $text, $fg, $bg ) = tb_get_cell( $x, $y, $back );

Reads a cell from the back (C<$back> true) or front buffer. C<$text> is the
cell's cluster as a string. Only C<$rc> is returned unless it is C<TB_OK>.

=head3 tb_print

	tb_print( $x, $y, $fg, $bg, $text );

Writes a string cell by cell, advancing by each cluster's width.

=head3 tb_send

	tb_send($bytes);

Queues bytes for the terminal, for escape sequences termbox2 has no
function for. A string whose characters are all below 0x100 is sent
byte for byte, whether or not Perl stores it UTF-8 encoded; a string
with a wider character is sent UTF-8 encoded. Like everything termbox2
writes, the bytes stay in its output buffer until the next
C<tb_present> or C<tb_shutdown>.

=head3 tf_reset_attrs

	my $rc = tf_reset_attrs();

A Term::Fabulous addition. Queues the reset of all colors and styles
(C<SGR 0>), for escape sequences sent with L</tb_send> that depend on
them, such as erasing (it uses the current background color). The next
cell C<tb_present> draws sets its colors again, which termbox2 would
otherwise skip when it believes the terminal still has them.

=head3 tf_flush

	my $rc = tf_flush();

A Term::Fabulous addition. Writes what L</tb_send> and the drawing
functions queued, without waiting for the next C<tb_present>.

=head2 Events

=head3 tb_peek_event

	my $rc = tb_peek_event( $event, $timeout_ms );

Waits up to C<$timeout_ms> for an event and fills C<$event>, a
L<Term::Fabulous::Termbox::Event>, in place. Returns C<TB_OK>,
C<TB_ERR_NO_EVENT> after the timeout, or an error. C<$event> is untouched
unless the result is C<TB_OK>.

=head3 tb_poll_event

	my $rc = tb_poll_event($event);

Like L</tb_peek_event> without a timeout.

=head3 tf_install_input_parser

	my $rc = tf_install_input_parser();

A Term::Fabulous addition. Installs a reader that runs before termbox2's
own escape sequence parsers and decodes what they get wrong: Escape
followed by a key in the same read becomes that key with C<TB_MOD_ALT>
(Alt+x, Alt+Enter, Alt plus an umlaut), and SGR mouse reports keep
their modifier bits (C<TB_MOD_SHIFT>, C<TB_MOD_ALT>, C<TB_MOD_CTRL>),
report the pointer moving with no button as C<TF_KEY_MOUSE_MOVE> with
C<TB_MOD_MOTION>, and report a horizontal wheel as
C<TF_KEY_MOUSE_WHEEL_LEFT> and C<TF_KEY_MOUSE_WHEEL_RIGHT>, and say
which button a C<TB_KEY_MOUSE_RELEASE> released: the event's C<ch> is
C<TB_KEY_MOUSE_LEFT>, C<TB_KEY_MOUSE_MIDDLE> or C<TB_KEY_MOUSE_RIGHT>
(0 when the terminal did not name the button, as in reports termbox2
decodes itself). Escape
sequences that begin with C<ESC [> or C<ESC O> and are not SGR mouse
reports are left to termbox2. C<tb_shutdown> forgets the parser, so
call this after every C<tb_init>. Returns C<TB_OK>.

It also decodes the key reports of the
L<kitty keyboard protocol|https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/>,
C<ESC [ code ; modifiers u>, and the legacy forms of the function keys,
C<ESC [ number ; modifiers ~> and C<ESC [ 1 ; modifiers letter>, when
they carry modifiers. kitty's Super, Hyper and Meta become
C<TF_MOD_SUPER>, C<TF_MOD_HYPER> and C<TF_MOD_META>; Caps Lock and Num
Lock are dropped. The keys come as termbox2 would report them from a
legacy terminal wherever that report is exact, so code written for
termbox2 keeps working:

=over

=item *

Escape is C<TB_KEY_ESC>; Enter, Tab and Backspace without Ctrl are
their control byte with C<TB_MOD_CTRL>, as termbox2 reports the bytes;
Shift+Tab is C<TB_KEY_BACK_TAB>.

=item *

Ctrl plus a letter, Space, C<\> or C<]> is its control byte (Ctrl+C is
C<TB_KEY_CTRL_C>), with C<TB_MOD_SHIFT> and the other modifiers added
when they were held.

=item *

What the legacy encoding cannot carry has its character in C<ch>
instead, with exact modifiers: Ctrl plus Enter, Tab, Backspace or
Escape (C<ch> is the control byte), and Ctrl plus a key whose control
byte is another key's or that has none (Ctrl+I, Ctrl+M, Ctrl+H, Ctrl+[,
Ctrl+1, ...; C<ch> is the unshifted character).

=item *

Alt, Super, Hyper or Meta plus a key without Ctrl is the character
Shift makes in C<ch>, without C<TB_MOD_SHIFT>, like Alt plus a key from
a legacy terminal: Alt+Shift+1 is C<!> with C<TB_MOD_ALT> when the
terminal reports the shifted key (kitty's "report alternate keys"
flag), and Alt+Shift+a is C<A> either way.

=item *

The keys without a legacy encoding are the L</Kitty keys>.

=back

kitty sends these reports for the keys that have no legacy encoding
even to programs that did not ask for the protocol. For the others,
ask the terminal with C<< tb_send("\e[>5u") >> after
L</tf_kitty_keyboard_query> found it supported, and send C<"\e[<u">
before C<tb_shutdown>, as L<Term::Fabulous> does.

The parser only decodes; to receive motion reports at all, ask the
terminal with C<< tb_send("\e[?1003h") >> (and send C<"\e[?1003l">
before C<tb_shutdown>), as L<Term::Fabulous> does.

=head3 tf_cursor_position

	my $rc = tf_cursor_position( $timeout_ms, \my $x, \my $y );

A Term::Fabulous addition. Asks the terminal where its cursor is
(C<ESC [ 6 n>), waits up to C<$timeout_ms> milliseconds for the answer
and stores the column and the row, counted from 0, through the
references. Input that arrives meanwhile, such as keys typed ahead,
stays queued for L</tb_peek_event>; it is read already, so the
terminal descriptor no longer reports it as readable. Returns
C<TB_OK>, C<TB_ERR_NO_EVENT> when no answer arrived in time, or
another error; the references are untouched unless the result is
C<TB_OK>. Dies unless both references are scalar references.

=head3 tf_kitty_keyboard_query

	my $rc = tf_kitty_keyboard_query( $timeout_ms, \my $supported );

A Term::Fabulous addition. Asks the terminal whether it speaks the
L<kitty keyboard protocol|https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/>:
it sends the query for the protocol's flags (C<ESC [ ? u>) followed by
the one for the primary device attributes (C<ESC [ c>), which every
terminal answers, and waits up to C<$timeout_ms> milliseconds for
that answer. C<$supported> is then 1 when the terminal reported its
flags, 0 when it answered the device attributes alone. Both answers
are taken out of the input; keys that arrive meanwhile stay queued for
L</tb_peek_event>, as with L</tf_cursor_position>. Returns C<TB_OK>,
C<TB_ERR_NO_EVENT> when no answer arrived in time (the terminal is
taken not to speak the protocol), or another error; C<$supported> is
untouched unless the result is C<TB_OK>. Dies unless the argument is
a scalar reference.

=head3 tf_readable_bytes

	my $count = tf_readable_bytes($fd);

A Term::Fabulous addition. The number of bytes waiting to be read from
the file descriptor (C<ioctl FIONREAD>), or -1 when the descriptor
cannot tell (C<$!> says why). A terminal descriptor that is readable
while this returns 0 is at end of file: the terminal is gone. A
terminal that hung up returns -1 with C<$!> set to C<EIO>.

=head3 tb_get_fds

	my $rc = tb_get_fds( \my $tty_fd, \my $resize_fd );

Stores termbox2's tty and resize-pipe descriptors through the references,
for an event loop that waits on them itself. Dies unless both arguments
are scalar references.

=head2 Widths

=head3 tb_iswprint

	my $printable = tb_iswprint($codepoint);

=head3 tb_wcwidth

	my $columns = tb_wcwidth($codepoint);

The columns one codepoint takes: 0, 1, 2, or -1 for a codepoint that is
not printable.

=head3 tb_cluster_width

	my $columns = tb_cluster_width($cluster);

The columns a grapheme cluster takes, measured the way C<tb_present> does:
the widest codepoint's width, forced to 1 when the cluster holds a
variation selector 15 (text presentation) and to 2 when it holds a
variation selector 16 (emoji presentation), a zero-width joiner or two
regional indicators. Clusters below width 1 still occupy one cell when
drawn. Dies on an empty string.

=head2 Diagnostics

=head3 tb_last_errno, tb_strerror

	my $message = tb_strerror($rc);

=head3 tb_has_truecolor, tb_has_egc, tb_attr_width, tb_version

Report the compile-time options: 1, 1, 64 and the termbox2 version string.

=head1 NOT BOUND

C<tb_printf>, C<tb_sendf> and C<tb_printf_ex> (variadic; format in Perl and
use L</tb_print> or L</tb_send>), the deprecated C<tb_set_func> and
C<tb_cell_buffer> (use L</tb_get_cell>), and the C<tb_utf8_*> helpers
(Perl strings are already Unicode).
