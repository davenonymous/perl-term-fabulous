=head1 NAME

Term::Fabulous::Render::Frame - What one frame paints, command by
command

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Term::Fabulous::Render::Frame;

	my $frame = Term::Fabulous::Render::Frame->new(
		commands => $ui->render,    # Clay's render commands
		width    => $ui->width,
		height   => $ui->height,
	);

	foreach my $index ( 0 .. $frame->command_count - 1 ) {
		my $command = $frame->command($index);
		my ( $x0, $y0, $x1, $y1 ) = @{ $frame->clip_rect($index) };
		...
	}

	# The commands painted at a cell, the topmost first.
	my @indices = $frame->topmost_at( 12, 3 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Most programs never use this module directly. L<Term::Fabulous::Render>
builds a Frame from the render commands Clay laid out, before it paints
any of them, and keeps the Frame of the last frame
(L<Term::Fabulous::Render/last_frame>). L<Term::Fabulous> hit-tests the
mouse pointer with it, and L<Term::Fabulous::Render::Canvas> uses it to
decide which canvases can keep their cells.

A Frame is read-only. It works out (the painted cells on the first call
that needs them, the rest when it is constructed):

=over

=item * the paint order

The order of Clay's commands, with one addition: Clay carries the
background of a canvas in the canvas's own command, and the frame
paints it as a rectangle right before that command.

=item * the clip rect of every command

The rectangle of cells the command may paint into: the viewport
(C<[0, 0, width, height]>), narrowed to the innermost scissor around
the command. Clay surrounds the content of a clipping element, such as
a L<scroll box|Term::Fabulous::Widget::ScrollBox>, with a C<SCISSOR_START>
and a C<SCISSOR_END> command; a scissor nested inside another is
narrowed to it. Boxes are snapped to whole cells like everywhere else
(see L<Term::Fabulous::Render::Geometry/cell_rect>).

=item * the cells every command paints

Rectangles, text and canvases paint their box, borders the one-cell
edge of every side whose Clay border width is greater than 0, and
scissors nothing; all of them only inside their clip rect.

=back

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

	my $frame = Term::Fabulous::Render::Frame->new( commands => \@commands, width => 80, height => 24 );

C<commands> is an array reference of render commands in the format of
L<Clay::XS/RENDER COMMANDS>, in the order Clay emitted them; C<width>
and C<height> are the size of the viewport in cells, numbers of at
least 0. The command hashes are kept as they are, not copied.

Dies with a message starting with C<Term::Fabulous::Render::Frame:>
when an argument is invalid, when a command has a type other than
rectangle, border, text, scissor start or end and custom
(C<unhandled render command type IMAGE>; Term::Fabulous widgets produce
only these), and when a C<SCISSOR_END> has no open scissor.

=head1 METHODS

All C<$index> arguments are positions in the paint order, from 0 to
C<command_count - 1>; any other value dies.

=head2 commands

	my @commands = $frame->commands;

The render commands in paint order. The hashes are Clay's own: read
them, do not change them. Use C<< $ui->widget_for( $command->{userData} ) >>
to get the widget a command belongs to.

=head2 command_count

	my $count = $frame->command_count;

The number of commands.

=head2 command

	my $command = $frame->command($index);

One command, as in L</commands>.

=head2 width, height

	my ( $columns, $rows ) = ( $frame->width, $frame->height );

The size of the viewport the Frame was built for.

=head2 clip_rect

	my ( $x0, $y0, $x1, $y1 ) = @{ $frame->clip_rect($index) };

The rectangle of cells the command may paint into, as a new array
reference C<[x0, y0, x1, y1]>. C<x1> and C<y1> are exclusive, so the
rectangle covers the columns C<x0 .. x1 - 1> and the rows
C<y0 .. y1 - 1>. When a scissor lies outside the viewport, the
rectangle is empty (C<x1 == x0> or C<y1 == y0>). A command outside its
clip rect, such as content scrolled out of a scroll container, paints
nothing.

=head2 painted_rects

	my @rects = $frame->painted_rects($index);

The non-empty C<[x0, y0, x1, y1]> rectangles the command paints, as new
array references; none for a scissor or for a command outside its clip
rect, up to four (one per edge) for a border.

=head2 painted_after

	my $covered = $frame->painted_after( $index, [ $x0, $y0, $x1, $y1 ] );

1 when a command painted after the one at C<$index> paints into the
given rectangle, otherwise 0. A canvas that something is painted over
cannot keep its cells from the last frame.

=head2 topmost_at

	my @indices = $frame->topmost_at( $x, $y );

The indices of the commands that paint the cell C<($x, $y)>, the
topmost (the one painted last) first. Empty when nothing is painted
there.
