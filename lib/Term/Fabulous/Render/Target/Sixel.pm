=head1 DESCRIPTION

Most programs never use this module directly. Read on if you write a
cell target (see L<Term::Fabulous::Render/CELL TARGET>) that can show
the pictures of L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::Sixel>.

Sixel pictures are not cells: the terminal draws them over the cells,
from the cell at the cursor on. A cell target that composes this role
tells L<Term::Fabulous::Render> the size of a cell in pixels, and the
renderer hands it the pictures of every frame, with the cells each one
covers, after the frame's cells are painted and before
C<end_frame>. A target without this role, or one whose
L</sixel_cell_size> is empty, shows no pictures: the Sixel widgets show
a notice instead.

The role has no methods of its own; the target provides all three.
L<Term::Fabulous::Terminal::Termbox::Cells> composes it for the real
terminal, L<Term::Fabulous::Render::Target::Grid> for
L<Term::Fabulous::Terminal::Memory> and L<Term::Fabulous::Static>.

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=head2 sixel_cell_size

	my ( $width, $height ) = $target->sixel_cell_size;

The width and the height of a cell in pixels, both whole numbers of at
least 1, when the target can show sixel pictures; else an empty list.
The answer may change between frames, for example when the terminal's
font size changes.

=head2 sixel_area

	my $rect = $target->sixel_area( $width, $height );

The C<[x0, y0, x1, y1]> rectangle of cells a picture may cover in a
frame of C<$width> x C<$height> cells, inside the frame. The renderer
cuts every picture to it. A terminal leaves out its last row, for
example, because a picture that reaches it makes the screen scroll.

=head2 show_sixels

	$target->show_sixels(@placements);

Called once per frame, after the frame's cells are painted and before
C<end_frame>, with the frame's pictures in paint order, none when the
frame has none. Each placement is a hash reference:

=over

=item C<x>, C<y>

The cell the picture's top left corner covers.

=item C<columns>, C<rows>

The cells the picture covers, at least 1 each; the picture is
C<columns> times the cell width wide and C<rows> times the cell height
high.

=item C<data>

The picture as SIXEL data: a byte string that starts with C<ESC P>.

=back

The pictures of a frame replace those of the frame before: a picture
that is not given again must disappear, and the cells it covered must
show what the frame painted there. Transparent pixels of a picture
leave the cells below them visible; the renderer makes the pixels of
cells that something painted over the picture transparent.
