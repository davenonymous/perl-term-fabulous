=head1 NAME

Term::Fabulous::Render::Target::Grid - Cell target that keeps the
painted cells in memory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Term::Fabulous::Render::Target::Grid;

	my $grid = Term::Fabulous::Render::Target::Grid->new;

	# Term::Fabulous::Static and Term::Fabulous::Terminal::Memory paint
	# into one; read it back:
	my ( $glyph, $fg, $bg ) = @{ $grid->cell( 0, 0 ) };
	my $line = $grid->row_text( 0, columns => 20, colors => 0 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Most programs never use this module directly:
L<Term::Fabulous::Static> and L<Term::Fabulous::Terminal::Memory> paint
into a Grid and read it back as text. Use their C<cell_target> to
inspect exactly what was painted into each cell, for example in tests.

This is a cell target (see L<Term::Fabulous::Render/CELL TARGET>) that
stores every painted cell instead of drawing it, built on
L<Term::Fabulous::Render::Target::Mask>. Each frame starts from an
empty grid, except for the kept rectangles of unchanged canvases.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

	my $grid = Term::Fabulous::Render::Target::Grid->new;
	my $grid = Term::Fabulous::Render::Target::Grid->new( sixel_cell_size => [ 10, 20 ] );

An empty grid; it grows to whatever is painted into it. With
C<sixel_cell_size>, C<[width, height]> in pixels, both whole numbers of
at least 1, it stands for a terminal that shows sixel graphics with
cells of that size, and records the pictures of every frame (see
L</sixels>); without it, the default, it shows none, and
L<Term::Fabulous::Widget::Sixel> shows a notice. Unknown parameters
die.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 cell

	my $cell = $grid->cell( $x, $y );
	my ( $glyph, $fg, $bg ) = @$cell if $cell;

The cell at column C<$x>, row C<$y> (from 0) as an array reference
C<[ $glyph, $fg, $bg ]>, or C<undef> if nothing painted it in the last
frame.

=over

=item *

C<$glyph> is a character string: the base character plus any combining
characters of its grapheme cluster.

=item *

C<$fg> and C<$bg> are the termbox2 attributes the render roles computed
(see L<Term::Fabulous::Render::Attr>): C<0xRRGGBB>, C<TB_DEFAULT> (0) for
the terminal default color, C<TB_HI_BLACK> for black, possibly
combined with flags such as C<TB_REVERSE>. Background fills
store C<TB_DEFAULT> as the foreground.

=item *

A wide cluster (two columns) is stored in the cell it starts in only.
The cell to its right is not written for it: it holds whatever was
painted there earlier in the frame (usually the background fill, a
space) or C<undef>. When you read a row cell by cell, skip as many cells
after a glyph as L<Term::Fabulous::Unicode/cluster_columns> reports for
it, as L</row_text> does.

=back

=head2 row_text

	my $line = $grid->row_text( $y, columns => 80 );
	my $line = $grid->row_text( $y, columns => 80, colors => 1, trim_trailing_whitespace => 0 );

Row C<$y> as a line of text, C<columns> cells wide (required); cells
nothing painted read as spaces, and a wide glyph takes the cells it
covers. Options:

=over

=item C<colors>

A boolean, default 0. When true, every run of cells with the same
colors is preceded by an ANSI SGR sequence with 24-bit colors
(C<ESC [ 38;2;R;G;B m> for the foreground, C<48;2;...> for the
background), C<7> (reverse video) for cells in reverse video, and C<1>
(bold), C<2> (dim), C<3> (italic), C<4> (underline), C<5> (blink), C<8>
(conceal), C<9> (strikeout), C<21> (double underline) and C<53>
(overline) for those termbox2 flags (the table
L<Term::Fabulous::Render::Attr/STYLE_FLAGS>); the line ends with
C<ESC [ 0 m> when it set any. The terminal's default colors get no
sequence.

=item C<trim_trailing_whitespace>

A boolean, default 1. When true, cells at the end of the row that would
print as plain spaces are left out: cells nothing painted, and spaces
in the terminal's default background and not in reverse video.

=back

Unknown options die. The
L<C<render_lines>|Term::Fabulous::Static/render_lines> method of
Term::Fabulous::Static and the L<C<lines>|Term::Fabulous::Terminal::Memory/lines>
method of Term::Fabulous::Terminal::Memory are built on it.

=head2 grid_height

	my $rows = $grid->grid_height;

The number of rows up to and including the last row anything was
painted in.

=head2 grid_row

	my $cells = $grid->grid_row($y);

The cells of row C<$y> as an array reference of the values L</cell>
returns, which may contain C<undef> holes; an empty array reference for
a row nothing was painted in.

=head2 painted_cell

	my ( $glyph, $fg, $bg ) = $grid->painted_cell( $x, $y );

The contents of L</cell> as a list, or an empty list when the cell is
C<undef>. See L<Term::Fabulous::Render/painted_cell>.

=head2 sixels

	foreach my $picture ( $grid->sixels ) {
		my ( $x, $y, $columns, $rows, $data ) = @{$picture}{qw(x y columns rows data)};
	}

The sixel pictures of the last frame, as copies of the placements
L<Term::Fabulous::Render::Target::Sixel/show_sixels> describes: the
cell of the top left corner, the cells covered and the SIXEL data.
Empty without C<sixel_cell_size>.

=head2 Cell target methods

C<begin_frame>, C<end_frame>, C<release_rect>, C<set_cell>,
C<extend_cell> and C<fill_row> come from
L<Term::Fabulous::Render::Target::Mask>, which builds them on the
primitives below.

=head2 clear_cells

	$grid->clear_cells(@kept_rects);

Primitive: forgets every cell outside the given C<[x0, y0, x1, y1]>
rectangles (all cells without rectangles).

=head2 present_cells

Primitive. Does nothing.

=head2 put_cell

	$grid->put_cell( $x, $y, $glyph, $fg, $bg );

Primitive: stores one cell.

=head2 put_extension

	$grid->put_extension( $x, $y, $character );

Primitive: appends a combining character to a stored cell. Dies if
nothing was stored there.

=head2 put_row

	$grid->put_row( $x, $y, $columns, $bg );

Primitive: stores C<$columns> spaces with the background C<$bg>.

=head2 sixel_cell_size, sixel_area, show_sixels

The methods of L<Term::Fabulous::Render::Target::Sixel>:
C<sixel_cell_size> is the C<sixel_cell_size> given to L</new>, or empty;
C<sixel_area> is the whole frame; C<show_sixels> records the pictures
L</sixels> returns.
