=head1 NAME

Term::Fabulous::Screenshot::Runner - Run a program in a pseudo terminal
and capture its screen

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Term::Fabulous::Screenshot::Runner;

	my $screen = Term::Fabulous::Screenshot::Runner->new->capture(
		script  => 'examples/form.pl',
		columns => 80,
		rows    => 24,
		epoch   => 1780306860,
		steps   => [ { action => 'wait', seconds => 0.5 } ],
	);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Maintainer tool, not installed. Starts a Perl program in a new pseudo
terminal of a fixed size, as a separate process, with
L<Term::Fabulous::Screenshot::Harness> loaded first, and returns the
screen as a L<Term::Fabulous::Screenshot::Screen>.

The program runs in an empty temporary directory, with a fixed
environment: C<TERM=xterm-256color>, C<COLORTERM=truecolor>,
C<LC_ALL=C.UTF-8>, C<TZ=UTC>, a fixed hash seed, and only C<PATH> and
C<HOME> taken over. Together with the virtual clock, this makes every
run produce the same screen.

=over

=item *

A program that runs an event loop (every L<Term::Fabulous> program) is
captured by the harness after its steps: the screen is what the
terminal showed at that moment.

=item *

A program that prints and ends (a report printed with
L<Term::Fabulous::Static>) is captured from its output, as a terminal
would show it.

=back

The runner also plays the part of the terminal where a program asks it
something: it answers the cursor position query C<ESC [ 6 n> that
L<Term::Fabulous/INLINE MODE> sends, so inline programs can be captured.
The cursor starts on the row below the C<shell> lines (see L</capture>)
and follows the absolute cursor moves (C<ESC [ row ; column H>) in the
program's output. Other questions (such as the kitty keyboard protocol
query) get no answer, as from a terminal that does not know them.

The capture dies when the program writes anything to STDERR (warnings
included), ends with a non-zero exit status, ends before the screenshot
was taken, runs longer than the timeout, or prints output that is not
plain text with colors. A program that runs too long, and one whose
capture is interrupted by SIGINT, SIGTERM or SIGHUP, is killed together
with the processes it started.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

=over

=item C<include_dirs>

The library directories the program is run with (as C<-I> options).
Default: the directories in C<@INC>. They must include the one that
holds the harness.

=item C<timeout>

Real seconds a program may run. Default: 120.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 capture

	my $screen = $runner->capture(%job);

=over

=item C<script>

The program to run.

=item C<arguments>

An array reference of arguments for the program. Optional.

=item C<columns>, C<rows>

The size of the terminal.

=item C<epoch>

The start time of the virtual clock, in epoch seconds.

=item C<shell>

An array reference of lines a shell printed before the program started.
Optional. The cursor starts at the beginning of the row below them (on
the last row when they fill the terminal), and the harness shows them
above the program's inline region; see
L<Term::Fabulous::Screenshot::Scenario/Settings>.

=item C<steps>

The steps for the harness: C<{ action =E<gt> 'wait', seconds =E<gt> N }>
and C<{ action =E<gt> 'send', bytes =E<gt> HEX }>; see
L<Term::Fabulous::Screenshot::Harness/CONFIGURATION>.
