# Terminals draw the box drawing (U+2500-U+257F) and block element
# (U+2580-U+259F) characters themselves instead of taking them from the
# font, so lines meet across cells without gaps and half blocks split a
# cell exactly; many draw the Braille patterns (U+2800-U+28FF) and the
# sextants (U+1FB00-U+1FB3B) too. These shapes do the same for the
# screenshot renderers.
#
# Shapes are in the coordinates of one cell, (0, 0) at its top-left
# corner, in whole units of the renderer (pixels for PNG, user units for
# SVG): rectangles, filled with the cell's foreground color mixed over its
# background (coverage 1 is the foreground itself), polylines stroked in
# the foreground color, and circles (Braille dots) filled with it.

=head1 NAME

Term::Fabulous::Screenshot::BoxDrawing - Box drawing and block element
characters as shapes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Term::Fabulous::Screenshot::BoxDrawing qw(is_drawn_glyph glyph_shapes);

	if ( is_drawn_glyph($glyph) ) {
		foreach my $shape ( glyph_shapes( $glyph, 9, 18, 1 ) ) {
			...    # { type => 'rect', x, y, width, height, coverage }
			       # { type => 'polyline', points => [ x1, y1, x2, y2, ... ], width }
			       # { type => 'circle', cx, cy, r }
		}
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Maintainer tool, not installed. Terminal emulators draw the box drawing
characters (U+2500 to U+257F) and the block elements (U+2580 to U+259F)
themselves rather than with the font, so that lines meet across cells
and half blocks split a cell exactly; many also draw the Braille
patterns (U+2800 to U+28FF) and the sextants of the "Symbols for Legacy
Computing" (U+1FB00 to U+1FB3B), which the chart widgets use. The
screenshot renderers do the same with the shapes this module computes,
which makes borders seamless, canvas pixels square and chart lines
crisp in every viewer, whatever font it has.

All 160 box drawing and block element characters are covered: light,
heavy and double lines and all their junctions, dashed lines, rounded
corners, diagonals, the eighth and half blocks, the quadrants and the
three shades; and all 256 Braille patterns (dots as circles on a 2 x 4
grid) and all 60 sextants.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 is_drawn_glyph

True for a single character from U+2500 to U+259F, U+2800 to U+28FF or
U+1FB00 to U+1FB3B.

=head2 glyph_shapes

	my @shapes = glyph_shapes( $glyph, $cell_width, $cell_height, $line_thickness );

The shapes that draw C<$glyph> in a cell of the given size, in the
cell's coordinates, with light lines C<$line_thickness> thick (heavy
lines are twice that, double lines two light lines with a gap between
them). All three numbers must be positive whole numbers; rectangles then
have whole-number coordinates, so the same line lands on the same
pixels in every cell.

=over

=item C<< { type =E<gt> 'rect', x, y, width, height, coverage } >>

A filled rectangle. C<coverage> is how much of the foreground color
covers the background: 1 for solid shapes, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 for the
shades.

=item C<< { type =E<gt> 'polyline', points, width } >>

A line through the points (an array of x, y, x, y, ...) stroked
C<width> thick in the foreground color: the rounded corners and the
diagonals.

=item C<< { type =E<gt> 'circle', cx, cy, r } >>

A circle filled with the foreground color: a Braille dot. Its center and
radius may be fractions.

=back

Dies for a character outside the range or on invalid sizes.
